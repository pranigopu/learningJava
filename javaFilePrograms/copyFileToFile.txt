Copying a file's contents to another file
-----------------------------------------
This involves
1. Two file objects
2. An object to read from one file
3. An object to write to the other file 	

1.
Instantiate the two desired file objects, and create them if they don't exist. Let's say the file objects are 'source' and 'destination'.

2.
To make a file reader, we have multiple ways. One way is to use the 'FileReader' class, since it reads character-by-character, which is how I intend to write to the other file. Instantiate a 'FileReader' object using the 'source' 'File' object, in the manner explained in "readFromFile.txt". Of course, import the necessary modules and classes as required.

3.
To make a file writer, we have multipe ways. One way is to use the 'FileOutputStream' class, which allows you to write characters into a file using a byte output stream to the file.

First, import the necessary modules and classes
	import the required classes
	import java.io.FileOutputStream;
	import java.io.IOException; //If not imported already

Next, instantiate the 'FileOutputStream' object
Instantiate the 'FileOutputStream' writer using the 'destination' 'File' object, such as
	FileOutputStream fw = new FileOutputStream(destination);

4.
Now, using the following loop, write to 'destination' the character read from 'source'
	int i;
	while((i = fr()) != -1)
        {
            fw.write((char)i);
        }

5.
Close the file streams using the 'close' method
	fr.close();
	fw.close();

The result is that the contents of 'source' will be in 'destination'.
