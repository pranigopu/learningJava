Java class instantiation
__
Instantiating a class means creating an object.
To create an object we use the keyword
--
---*---*---
1.
"new"
e.g.
public Student
{
	int id;
	String name;
}
public CMS
{	
	public static void main( )
	{
		//Creating objects
		Student student1 = new Student( );
		Student student2 = new Student( );
		
		//Initialising objects
		student1.id = 1;
		student1.name = “abc”;

		student2.id = 2; 		student2.name = “xyz”;
	}
}
