Package in Java is a mechanism to encapsulate a group of classes, sub packages and interfaces. It is a collection of classes, interfaces and other packages.

Purposes:
- Organise related classes and interfaces.
- Prevent name conflicts of classes and interfaces
  --since different classes/interfaces with the same name can be in different packages--
- Control access of classes and interfaces
